mpileup-tools
================

These scripts are based on Heng Li's [SAMTOOLS](https://github.com/samtools/samtools) alignment package.

They were made to be used in conjunction with the MAPS polymorphism pipeline as well as Comai lab bulk alignment scripts.

The parser has been updated to beta-mpileup-parser_vMEM-O.py. This version is comaptible with newer versions of bwa 0.7 and samtools 1.11, in most cases, it is better to use this newer version.
